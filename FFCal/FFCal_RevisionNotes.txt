16 April, 2009:

	Adding some functions to FFCal
		- FFCal_ToneResponse.m will measure response of tones to check the calibration
		- FFCal_ProcessGolay.m will process the response of each trial (since
			we need these data for FFCal_ToneResponse!!!!)

		Still need to go through and make sure things are working

		in particular, something needs to be done to get the caldata for each speaker to
		be used for the ToneResponse part.

		also, add some way to test amplitude variation?

1 June, 2009:
	Finished basics of FFCal_ToneResponse.m
	
	Added FFCal_SPLbandwidth.m to test/measure variation of SPL with bandwidth of 
	synthesized noise.  Narrowband sound or tones has higher rms value, and hence
	greater SPL, than broadband noise.  This is most likely due to the properties 
	RMS operation.  Need to figure out a way to correct for this.
